# Codecool.io

## Story

Drawing is fun even when you have no affinity for it. But it is even more fun when you can do it together with your friends! Our team have been playing with skribbl.io in the COVID-caranteen a lot so we decided to create our own implementation of this game.

## What are we attempting to learn?

- how to use websockets for 2-way communication between server and client
- how to use canvas for drawing
- how to work in a bigger team efficiently

## Tasks

1. As a User, I want to be able to draw the given word on a white board.

2. As a User, I want my drawing to be broadcasted to all other players.

3. As a User, I want to have a more advanced drawing canvas with the ability to choose pen width, color, clear board etc.

4. As a User, I want to have a home page where I can create a new room for my friends.

5. As a User, I want to be able to join existing rooms.

6. As a User, I want to be sure that our game is only visible for those who have joined the room.

7. As a User, I want to be able to play a game with a given number of rounds with my friends. In a round everyone draws their words and they all have a given time interval to do this.

8. As a User, I want to be able to guess the word using a chat-like window. I want to get points based on how fast I guessed the word. I also want to be sure that I can only guess the solution once and that later on I cannot give it away to fellow players by inserting it into the chat.

9. As a User, I want to be able to see the final result at the end of the game in a table format.

10. As a User, I want to be able to select an avatar before entering the game.

11. As a User, I want as much data persisted as possible to ensure that I can reload the page at will.

12. As a User, I want to get random words from a database containing funny Codecool-related phrases.
